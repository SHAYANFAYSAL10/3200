                <div class="black-line"></div>
                <p>Before buying any product from Faysal IT (Faysal IT IT Limited or Faysal IT Computers Limited) it is important to
                    pay attention to the set of warranty policies mentioned below. Because the sale of any product means
                    that the buyer has made the purchase in consent with the terms and conditions mentioned below. The
                    product warranty that comes with a purchase is basically "Manufacturer's Warranty". It means the
                    manufacturer or the brand is responsible for the warranty issues. Each of the brands has different
                    warranty policy, which is clearly mentioned on their respective websites. In this case, the Faysal IT is
                    only responsible for selling the products to customers and helping manufacturers to implement the
                    terms and conditions of the warranty policy.</p>

                <h3 class="text">Terms and Conditions</h3>
                <div class="black-line"></div>
                <p>• All products do not come with a warranty. Warranty is only valid for products that purchased with a
                    warranty for a given period of time, mentioned in the bill or invoice issued by Faysal IT.</br>

                    • In the case of Product Lifetime Warranty, it remains valid as long as the manufacturer continues
                    the production of the particular product. If the manufacturer discontinues the production, the
                    warranty will remain valid as long as one year from the date of purchase.</br>

                    • International warranty will be covered only for those products that have an international warranty

                    company has its own service center.</br>
                    If the parts of the product claiming an international warranty are not there in that area/country,

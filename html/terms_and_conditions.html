                <p>"List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier,
                    or
                    seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on this website and other
                    retailers. Certain
                    products may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the
                    product on
                    this website.

                    With respect to items sold by this website, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order.
                    Despite our
                    best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of
                    an item
                    sold by this website is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you
                    for
                    instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other

                    follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.

                    or, for
                    digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.</p>
